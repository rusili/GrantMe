# Genie

Genie was conceived and completed during a C4Q hackathon allowing users to  navigate all educational and vocational programs provided by Workforce grants throughout New York City  via the NYC Open Data API, allowing users to find and/or change their careers free of charge.

Users are able to create a new profile and log on to view all of the educational and vocational programs within the five boroughs. They were then able to narrow down their search by filtering by borough or vocation, or even do a direct search. Once they find a program they like, they would be able to save it to their favortes to be viewed later.
